      <p class="overview-items"> Gaugebox LP needed help defining a new market. A "missing" solution for collaboration between labs was needed. We started with paper sketchs from the Founder. Then moved into user research. From there we began a cycle of iteration and implementation.
        A year and a half later our parent company is ready to deploy Gaugebox. </p>

    ## WIKA, Part of your business Something to mention is that this Startup is actually a part of a larger corporation. WIKA Instrument LP, a leader in the measurement industry with around 40 locations worldwide and it’s Headquarters in Germany. This gave
    our startup culture a unique spin since we are not “bootstrapped” and have access to a large audience immediately.

    Moving on, I came in at square one. The Founder, Lead Developer, and myself spent the first few weeks in front of whiteboards. Trying to translate the Founders ideas and dreams into something that we could begin building. I didn’t push a pixel the entire
    time. Instead, I filled a notebook with sketchs and thoughts. After a few weeks we had a concept and a target. And so begin the journey.
